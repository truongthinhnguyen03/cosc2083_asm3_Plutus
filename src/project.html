						Our group topic is a financial management web application, supported for 
						personal spending and the team’s budget. For individuals, this application will 
						allow users to keep track of their daily expenses, and payment history through 
						visualization and comparison of spending among different periods. 
						Based on the result, users are given recommendations to adjust their expenditure 
						on specific categories and notified when the spending level exceeds the proposed 
						budget. On a larger scale, regarding teams, the application would enable team managers 
						to monitor organizational expenses, ensuring that they are within budget. In addition, 
						team members’ budgets are distributed by the manager and their spending will be recorded 
						for better tracking.
